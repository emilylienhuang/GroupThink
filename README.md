# **Graph Theory and Social Networks Project: Segregation Models and Economic Theories**

This project explores the application of graph theory in understanding social networks, focusing on concepts inspired by economists Thomas Schelling, Vladyslav Nora, and Eyal Winter. Originally proposed for a social networks graph theory applications course, the project was selected to be included as a supplementary assignment for future iterations of the course. The project combines innovative graph-theoretical techniques with real-world economic theories to model and analyze social behaviors.

## **Project Overview**

### **Objective**
To model and analyze social network dynamics using graph theory principles, specifically focusing on:
- **Segregation models**: Simulating how individual preferences and connections lead to group formation and segregation within networks.
- **Economic interactions**: Incorporating decision-making and utility functions based on theories from Schelling, Nora, and Winter.

### **Key Features**
- **Originality**: All ideas and methodologies are original, grounded in advanced graph theory and inspired by the work of renowned economists.
- **Educational Integration**: Designed as a homework assignment to deepen students’ understanding of graph theory applications in social networks.
- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Combines graph theory, economics, and social science to solve complex real-world problems.

## **Core Concepts**

### **1. Schelling's Segregation Model**
- Implements agent-based modeling on a graph to simulate segregation based on individual preferences.
- Explores the role of "tipping points" in network structure, demonstrating how small preference changes can lead to large-scale segregation.

### **2. Vladyslav Nora's Utility-Based Network Dynamics**
- Models individual agents’ decisions based on utility maximization, analyzing the formation of stable social clusters.
- Demonstrates the impact of economic incentives and costs on network connectivity.

### **3. Eyal Winter’s Strategic Interactions**
- Incorporates game theory into social networks, exploring strategic interactions and equilibrium states within a graph.
- Focuses on how cooperation or competition emerges in different network topologies.

## **How It Works**

### **Input**
- A graph representation of a social network (specifically grids).
- Node attributes or row, col tuples representing individual preferences, utilities, or strategic choices.

### **Simulation Steps**
1. **Initialize the Graph**:
   - Define nodes, edges, and initial attributes (e.g., preferences, utilities).
2. **Model Dynamics**:
   - Implement rules based on Schelling, Nora, or Winter's theories to simulate interactions over multiple iterations.
3. **Analyze Results**:
   - Evaluate segregation levels, cluster formations, or strategic outcomes.

### **Output**
- Visualizations of network changes over time.
- Metrics quantifying segregation, utility optimization, or strategic behavior.
- Insights into how network topology influences social outcomes.
