This is a project I proposed for a social networks graph theory applications course. 
My proposal was selected to be used as a supplementary assignment for the next iteration of the course which is why the project proposal provided is framed as a homework assignment.
All ideas are original and based on the work of economists Thomas Schelling, Vladyslav Nora, and Eyal Winter.
